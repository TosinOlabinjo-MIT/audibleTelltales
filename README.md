audibleTelltales

Telltales are pieces of string used in sailing to indicate whether there is turbulent or laminar flow across the sail. However, the different colored pieces of yarn attached to each side of the sail are purely visual indicators. These audible telltales are an assistive device that aims to communicate the visual information in an auditory form for both sighted and visually-impaired sailors, such as Pauline.

The device consists of an input system, which reads the motion of the telltale, and an output system, which emits a series of beeps conveying airflow information.

Access to soldering equipment and a 3D printer is required in the fabrication of this device.
